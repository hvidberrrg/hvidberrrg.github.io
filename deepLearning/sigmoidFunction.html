            <p>The sigmoid function is a continuous, monotonically increasing function with a 
            characteristic 'S'-like curve, and possesses several interesting properties that 
            make it an obvious choice as an activation function in artificial neural networks. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The domain of the sigmoid function is the set of all real numbers, \(\mathbb{R}\),
            and it's defined as:
            
            <span class="marginnote"><br/><br/>Please note that equation (1) could just as well
            be written as \(\sigma(x) = \frac{e^x}{{e^x} + 1}\) (seen by multiplying equation
            (1) by \(\frac{e^x}{e^x}\), i.e. multiplying by 1).
            </span>
            $$\begin{equation}
            \label{eq:sigmoid_function}
            \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
            \end{equation}$$
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The graph of the function illustrates its smooth, gradual transition from values 
            just above \(0\) to values just below \(1\) - a transition that almost fully occurs
            in the interval \(-5 \lt x \lt 5\).
            </p>

            	<span class="caption">Figure 1: The elongated 'S'-like curve of the sigmoid function</span>

			<p>
			From equation \eqref{eq:sigmoid_function} (and the smooth curves of the figure above) it's clear 
			<span class="marginnote"> *As \(x\) gets larger the value of \(e^{-x}\) tends towards \(0\).
			</span>
			that as \(x\) gets larger the value of \(\sigma(x)\) tends towards \(1\)*. Similarly it should be
		    evident that the limit of \(\sigma(x)\), as \(x\) approaches negative infinity, is \(0\). That is:
			</p>

            $$\begin{equation}
            \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \sigma(x) = 1
            \end{equation}$$
            $$\begin{equation}
            \lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} \sigma(x) = 0
            \end{equation}$$
            
            <p>
            I.e. the range of \(\sigma(x)\) is real numbers in the interval \(]0, 1[\), and there's
            a "soft step" between the <em>off</em> and <em>on</em> values represented by the extremes 
            of its range.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The derivative of the sigmoid function</h2>
            <p>
            Another interesting feature of the sigmoid function is that it's differentiable (a required
            trait when back-propagating errors).
            </p>
            <p>The derivative itself has a very convenient and beautiful form:</p>
            
            $$\begin{equation}
            \frac{d\sigma(x)}{dx} = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))
            \end{equation}$$

            <p>
            This means that it's very easy to compute the derivative of the sigmoid function if you've 
            already calculated the sigmoid function itself.
            </p>
